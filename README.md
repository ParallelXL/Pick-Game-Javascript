<h2>Changes I Made 😁</h2>
I made this Mobile responsive because the code in the course is only focusing on javscript and their game is not responsive


<h2>How to play ❓</h2>

Goal of the game is to get 100 points <br>
You roll a dice to increase current points
You can hold the current points to add in your score or reroll the dice but If you get 1 You lose your current points and the oppnent gets to roll.

I Made this two player javascript game while completing a course by Jonas Schmedtmann.
